I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch) under the supervision of [Andreas Krause](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDHv58AAAAAJ&hl=en)
and member of [Learning and Adaptive Systems Group](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/). I am also associated with the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/). 
I work on sequential decision-making and representation learning for structured data, such as â€‹point clouds or graphs.

**Research interests**\
The main question that motivates my research is: How can we actively learn new complex environments? 
My interests span multiple topics around sequential decision-making, bayesian optimization, representation learning, generative modeling.
I am sparked by designing robust algorithms with quantified uncertainty and well-understood limitations (theoretically and empirically), that would be applicable in society-critical areas.


Prior to ETH, I studied Maths, Physics, and Data Science at 
[MIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology) and 
[Skoltech](https://www.skoltech.ru/en) -- Moscow universities with great people and great courses.
I worked on deep learning for weakly-supervised semantic 
segmentation under the supervision of 
[Victor Lempitsky](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=gYYVokYAAAAJ&hl=en) 
and interned at Columbia University under the co-supervision of [Hod Lipson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F_Go4V4AAAAJ&hl=en). 
 I did ML internships at [Yandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex) (deep learning for [precipitation nowcasting](https://yandex.ru/pogoda/moscow/maps/nowcast?le_Lightning=1&ll=39.740119_56.398348&z=7)) 
 and Amazon Web Services (Bayesian optimization for AutoML).
