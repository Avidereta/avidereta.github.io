I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch) under the supervision of [Andreas Krause](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDHv58AAAAAJ&hl=en)
and member of [Learning and Adaptive Systems Group](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/). In my PhD, I have mostly been focusing on two areas: (1) making Bayesian optimization more robust and applicable at higher scale, and (2) representation learning for structured data, such as â€‹point clouds or graphs.

**Research interests**\
My current interests span multiple topics around probabilistic machine learning, including representation learning, bayesian optimization, generative modeling, and more generally learning on structured data, such as images and graphs. In a long term perspective of my research, I am sparked by designing robust algorithms with quantified uncertainty and well-understood limitations, empirically and theoretically.

Prior to ETH, I have graduated from 
[MIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology) and 
[Skoltech](https://www.skoltech.ru/en) -- Moscow universities with great people and great courses.
 At Skoltech, I worked on deep learning based methods for weakly-supervised semantic 
segmentation under the supervision of 
[Victor Lempitsky](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=gYYVokYAAAAJ&hl=en) 
and interned at Columbia University under the co-supervision of [Hod Lipson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F_Go4V4AAAAJ&hl=en). 
I have also interned at [Yandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex), where I worked on an interesting problem of deep learning based 
[precipitation nowcasting](https://yandex.ru/pogoda/moscow/maps/nowcast?le_Lightning=1&ll=39.740119_56.398348&z=7). 
These projects motivated me to consider two research problems in my PhD: 
uncertainty estimation in predictions and automatic hyperparameter tuning.
