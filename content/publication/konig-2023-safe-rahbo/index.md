abstract:
  "Controller tuning and parameter optimization are
crucial in system design to improve both the controller and
underlying system performance. Bayesian optimization has
been established as an efficient model-free method for controller
tuning and adaptation. Standard methods, however, are not
enough for high-precision systems to be robust with respect
to unknown input-dependent noise and stable under safety
constraints. In this work, we present a novel data-driven
approach, RaGooSe, for safe controller tuning in the presence
of heteroscedastic noise, combining safe learning with riskaverse Bayesian optimization. We demonstrate the method for
synthetic benchmark and compare its performance to established BO-based tuning methods. We further evaluate RaGoose
performance on a real precision-motion system utilized in
semiconductor industry applications and compare it to the
built-in auto-tuning routine."
