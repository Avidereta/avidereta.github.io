At its core, BO iteratively evaluates promising configurations until a user-defined budget, such as wall-clock time or number of iterations, is exhausted. While the final performance after tuning heavily depends on the provided budget, it is hard to pre-specify an optimal value in advance. In this work, we propose an effective and intuitive termination criterion for BO that automatically stops the procedure if it is sufficiently close to the global optimum. Our key insight is that the discrepancy between the true objective (predictive performance on test data) and the computable target (validation performance) suggests stopping once the suboptimality in optimizing the target is dominated by the statistical estimation error. Across an extensive range of real-world HPO problems and baselines, we show that our termination criterion achieves a better trade-off between the test performance and optimization time. Additionally, we find that overfitting may occur in the context of HPO, which is arguably an overlooked problem in the literature, and show how our termination criterion helps to mitigate this phenomenon on both small and large datasets.

The standard Bayesian optimization (BO) paradigm, however, optimizes the expected value only. We generalize BO to trade mean and input-dependent variance of the objective, both of which we assume to be unknown a priori. In particular, we propose a novel risk-averse heteroscedastic Bayesian optimization algorithm (RAHBO) that aims to identify a solution with high return and low noise variance, while learning the noise distribution on the fly. To this end, we model both expectation and variance as (unknown) RKHS functions, and propose a novel risk-aware acquisition function. We bound the regret for our approach and provide a robust rule to report the final decision point for applications where only a single solution must be identified. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAHBO on synthetic benchmark functions and hyperparameter tuning tasks.","tags":null,"title":"Risk-averse Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mikhail Usvyatsov","Anastasia Makarova","Rafael Ballester-Ripoll","Maxim Rakhuba","Andreas Krause","Konrad Schindler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622246400,"objectID":"8645af5d7341ea5595e5317150514e60","permalink":"/publication/usvyatsov-2020-cpic/","publishdate":"2021-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/usvyatsov-2020-cpic/","section":"publication","summary":"An end-to-end trainable framework that processes large-scale visual data tensors by looking at a fraction of their entries only","tags":null,"title":"Cherry-Picking Gradients: Learning Low-Rank Embeddings of Visual Data via Differentiable Cross-Approximation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anastasiia Makarova","Huibin Shen","Valerio Perrone","Aaron Klein","Jean Baptiste Faddoul","Andreas Krause","Matthias Seeger","Cedric Archambeau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618531200,"objectID":"82a7d010943083c5661a563b63863b48","permalink":"/publication/makarova-2020-stopbo/","publishdate":"2021-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makarova-2020-stopbo/","section":"publication","summary":"Tuning machine learning models with Bayesian optimization (BO) is a successful strategy to find good hyperparameters. BO defines an iterative procedure where a cross-validated metric is evaluated on promising hyperparameters. In practice, however, an improvement of the validation metric may not translate in better predictive performance on a test set, especially when tuning models trained on small datasets. In other words, unlike conventional wisdom dictates, BO can overfit. In this paper, we carry out the first systematic investigation of overfitting in BO and demonstrate that this issue is serious, yet often overlooked in practice. We propose a novel criterion to early stop BO, which aims to maintain the solution quality while saving the unnecessary iterations that can lead to overfitting. Experiments on real-world hyperparameter optimization problems show that our approach effectively meets these goals and is more adaptive comparing to baselines.","tags":null,"title":"Overfitting in Bayesian Optimization: an empirical study and early-stopping solution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anastasiia Makarova","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

We present a set of methods for leveraging information about the semantic hierarchy embedded in class labels. We first inject label-hierarchy knowledge into an arbitrary CNN-based classifier and empirically show that availability of such external semantic information in conjunction with the visual semantics from images boosts overall performance. Taking a step further in this direction, we model more explicitly the label-label and label-image interactions using order-preserving embeddings governed by both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries, prevalent in natural language, and tailor them to hierarchical image classification and representation learning. We empirically validate all the models on the hierarchical ETHEC dataset.","tags":null,"title":"Hierarchical Image Classification Using Entailment Cone Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
